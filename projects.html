                            Most of my projects are related to formal verification, "<i>the
                                act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended
                                algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain
                                formal specification or property, using formal methods
                                of
                                mathematics</i> (from Wikipedia)".
                            Formal verification requires multiple components 1) a target
                            program, 2) a mathematical specification for the program, 3)
                            a
                            mathematical relation to define the consistency between the
                            program and the specification,
                            and proofs and a proof checker to actually show the
                            correctness
                            of the program and the specification. The below figure shows
                            how
                            key components in formal verification are related to
                            others.<br /><br />

                            <br />
                            Formal verification has several granularities, and it is the
                            most strongest way to guarantee the correctness of the
                            software
                            (by showing the target software faithfully implements the
                            rigorous specification).
                            However, it is not practical due to the high verification
                            cost.
                            My main works are related to reducing the cost while fully
                            facilitating the power of formal verification. To do that,
                            we
                            usually use modular way
                            to separately verify multiple components in the software and
                            compose those proofs together to show the entire correctness
                            as

                            The Software 2.0 era has seen a significant increase in neural
                            network-based software and services, raising concerns about
                            potential costs related to neural network failures. Formal
                            verification stands out as the singular approach to ultimately
                            guarantee correctness, but challenges persist in the application
                            of formal verification to this domain. Even state-of-the-art
                            techniques for neural network verification face limitations in
                            two crucial verification components. Current methodologies do
                            not fully illustrate the complete behavior of neural networks as
                            formal specifications; instead, these techniques primarily focus
                            on local robustness. Furthermore, they continue to struggle with
                            the efficient management of large-scale models and face
                            challenges in achieving optimal reusability.
                            <br /> <br />
                            To address the stated challenges, our objective is to develop
                            the foundational theory and methodology for neural network
                            verification. Drawing inspiration from concepts in the formal
                            verification of conventional software and considering the
                            distinctive characteristics of neural network domains, we aim to
                            create a methodology that precisely articulates multiple desired
                            properties of target networks in a mathematically rigorous
                            manner, without restricting the types of these properties.
                            Furthermore, we put forward a modular verification approach
                            based on both the stated specifications and the target network
                            structure. We are confident that our endeavors will boost the
                            reliability of neural networks, thereby opening pathways for
                            building critical network-related applications and societal
                            advancements.

                            The low-level parts of distributed systems are usually built
                            with distributed consensus protocols that guarantees the
                            consistency in a certain level.
                            Among them, there are several strongly consistent protocols
                            such
                            as Paxos, Raft, and Chain-replication. They provides the
                            strong
                            guarantee that
                            users view the same state regardless of any kinds of network
                            and
                            local machine errors in distributed systems.
            
                            However, due to the complexity of those protocols,
                            application
                            builders usually use State Machine Replication (SMR) as a
                            abstraction of those protocols
                            that are used for the same purpose. However, SMR sacrifices
                            possessing all possible behaviors (i.e., partial failures)
                            of
                            those protocols in the model.
                            Therefore, we work on providing a proper but simple program

                                    concurrent OS kernels.
                                    Complete formal verification of a non-trivial concurrent OS
                                    kernel is widely considered a grand challenge.
                                    We present a novel compositional approach for building
                                    certified
                                    concurrent OS kernels.
                                    CertiKOS is not a fully practical operating system, but
                                    contains
                                    multiple services that can be used with restricted purposes.
                                    The below figure shows how we build CertiKOS with 6500 lines
                                    of
                                    C and x86 assembly.<br /><br />

                                    With the kernel, the main purpose of our formal verification
                                    is
                                    showing that all user programs running on top of our formal
                                    specification
                                    faithfully reflects the all behaviors of running the same
                                    user
                                    programs on top of the kernel implementation (see
                                    below).<br /><br />

                                    To show that, we aggressively decompose the kernel into
                                    multiple
                                    layers (65 layers) and granulary provide abstractions of

                                    layer.

                                    verification process. For example, MCS Lock formal

                                    and it is one of the most prevelent optimization techniques
